# bubble-sort
A python script for sorting strings from a data file.

This script will sort all the words found in a data file by length.
The words of the same length will be sorted lexicographically.

This script uses the sorting method known as "Bubble Sort".
Bubble Sort will compare each word against each other and switch when encountered a longer word.
This way, the longst word "floats" to the top, just like a bubble.

# How-to
1. Download the script
1. Put it in the same directory as the file you want to sort
1. Type in "python bubble_sort.py <FILENAME>" in your command-line.
